# OTA Log — Branch: main

[20:09:33] THINK: Prefer web-server UI + MCP/CLI adapters over TUI-only because reverse-engineering needs dense graphs/timelines and Claude/Codex already provide logged-in local agent runtimes.

[20:13:44] NOTE: Added docs/web-mcp-architecture.md sketch: local web server primary, MCP stdio surface, Claude/Codex local CLI adapters, project DB as durable truth, TUI removal after web parity.

_[Checkpoint: 6a038a58 — added docs/web-mcp-architecture.md; edited docs/web-mcp-architecture.md]_

[20:16:05] OBSERVE: docs/web-mcp-architecture.md exists (338 lines). Defines serve/mcp/analyze modes, REST surface, MCP resources+tools, agent bridge for claude/codex, Solid-free UI sketch. Gaps: no Finding schema, no event-delta design, agent bridge over-scoped, MCP resources duplicate tools, no auth/binding/cancellation.
[20:16:09] THINK: Fold refinements into existing doc rather than write -v2.md — single source of truth, easier review. Keep doc's structure (Product Shape → Modules → Modes → Web API → MCP → Agent Bridge → UI → Migration → Milestone) and inject new sections (Finding schema, Events, Auth, Cancellation, Shared Types) at natural seams. Revise rather than append where the original is wrong (resource list, event payload shape, milestone definition).
[20:17:41] ACT: wrote docs/web-mcp-architecture.md
[20:17:47] ACT: rewrote docs/web-mcp-architecture.md: added daemon+shim process model with Unix socket, granular event deltas with source attribution, Finding schema as first-class type, narrowed agent bridge to schema-bound non-interactive jobs only, trimmed MCP resources to 3 truly browseable ones, added auth/bind/dev-mode, CancellationToken design, ts-rs shared types, command palette as power-user spine, revised first milestone around live multi-source editing.
