# OTA Log — Branch: main

[20:09:33] THINK: Prefer web-server UI + MCP/CLI adapters over TUI-only because reverse-engineering needs dense graphs/timelines and Claude/Codex already provide logged-in local agent runtimes.

[20:13:44] NOTE: Added docs/web-mcp-architecture.md sketch: local web server primary, MCP stdio surface, Claude/Codex local CLI adapters, project DB as durable truth, TUI removal after web parity.

[20:16:05] OBSERVE: docs/web-mcp-architecture.md exists (338 lines). Defines serve/mcp/analyze modes, REST surface, MCP resources+tools, agent bridge for claude/codex, Solid-free UI sketch. Gaps: no Finding schema, no event-delta design, agent bridge over-scoped, MCP resources duplicate tools, no auth/binding/cancellation.
